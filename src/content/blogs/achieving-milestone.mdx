# Learning to Code Even When It Hurts

Let me be real for a second — coding gives me headaches.

Not the dramatic kind, the real ones. The kind where one small mistake ruins everything, the website breaks, nothing works, and you just sit there staring at the screen thinking, *“Yeah… I chose this life.”*

And yet, I still love it.

Because when things finally work, when the error disappears, when the page loads the way it’s supposed to — that feeling hits different.

## About Me

I’m Nihar.  
I’m not a “10x developer” or some coding genius. I’m a learner. Someone who’s figuring things out step by step, breaking stuff daily, fixing it slowly, and learning more every time.

I like building things — websites, blogs, portfolios — even when I don’t fully understand how everything works yet. I edit code I barely understand sometimes, mess things up, Google for hours, and somehow still move forward.

That’s the process.

## My Relationship With Coding

Coding is confusing.  
Coding is frustrating.  
Coding is humbling.

One day you feel unstoppable, the next day you can’t even center a div. But that’s exactly why I stick with it. It challenges me. It forces me to think, to be patient, to not give up when things don’t make sense immediately.

I don’t code because it’s easy.  
I code because I want to get better.

## Learning the Hard Way

Most of what I learn comes from doing — not tutorials alone. I deploy things, break them, redeploy, panic, then suddenly it works after 2 minutes “auto magically”.

Sometimes I don’t even know *why* it works — but I make sure to figure it out after. That’s how I learn. Trial, error, headache, repeat.

And yeah, it’s slow.  
But it’s real progress.

## Why I Won’t Quit

Because every bug teaches me something.  
Every error message makes me smarter.  
Every small win keeps me going.

I know I’ll learn it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow — but for sure over time. And when I look back at this blog later, I’ll know exactly where I started.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Blogs** about what I’m learning
- **Real experiences**, not fake success stories
- **Projects** I build while figuring things out
- **Honest thoughts** about coding, tech, and growth

## Conclusion

This blog isn’t about perfection.  
It’s about progress.

I’m learning. I’m struggling. I’m improving.  
And I’m not stopping.

If you’re reading this and you’re also stuck somewhere — trust me, you’re not alone. We’ll figure it out.
